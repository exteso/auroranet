## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented comprehensive admin event list and management view with real-time updates, delete functionality, and registration viewing.

**Admin Events Component (src/app/admin/events/):**

**Event List Features:**
- Real-time event loading using EventService.getEventsStream()
- Automatic sorting by date (ascending - soonest first)
- Card-based responsive layout with professional styling
- Each event card displays:
  - Title with status badge (SCHEDULED/FULL/CANCELLED/COMPLETED)
  - Formatted date (e.g., "Nov 15, 2025")
  - Time slot with hours (Morning 09:00-12:00, Afternoon 14:00-17:00)
  - Capacity and registration count (X/Y format)
  - Location (if provided)
  - Description (if provided)
  - Action buttons (View Registrations, Edit, Delete)

**Status Badges:**
- Color-coded visual indicators for each event status
- SCHEDULED: Blue background (#d1ecf1)
- FULL: Yellow background (#fff3cd)
- CANCELLED: Red background (#f8d7da)
- COMPLETED: Green background (#d4edda)
- Badge includes uppercase text with letter spacing

**Real-time Updates:**
- Uses getEventsStream() for live Firestore subscriptions
- Events automatically update when changed in database
- New events appear immediately
- Deleted events disappear immediately
- Registration counts update in real-time
- Status changes reflect instantly

**Delete Functionality:**
1. Click "Delete" button on any event
2. Confirmation modal appears with:
   - Event title for verification
   - Warning about action being irreversible
   - Warning that reservations will remain in database
   - "Delete Event" and "Cancel" buttons
3. Modal has dark overlay, click outside to cancel
4. Delete button shows "Deleting..." during operation
5. On success: modal closes, event removed via real-time stream
6. On error: error message displayed
7. Delete button disabled for past events

**View Registrations:**
1. Click "View Registrations" button on any event
2. Modal displays:
   - Event title and date/time info
   - Loading state while fetching
   - Numbered list of confirmed registrations
   - Each registration shows:
     - Display name (or "N/A" if not set)
     - Email address
     - Notes (if provided by user)
   - Empty state if no registrations
3. Uses ReservationService.getEventReservations()
4. Filters for CONFIRMED status only
5. Orders by creation date (first-come first-served)
6. Button disabled when registeredCount is 0

**Edit Button:**
- Currently disabled with tooltip "Edit functionality coming soon"
- Placeholder for future enhancement
- Styled in cyan (info color)
- Positioned between View Registrations and Delete
- Can be enabled later to navigate to edit form

**Loading States:**
- Initial page load shows "Loading events..." message
- Centered with gray text
- Disappears when events loaded
- Registrations modal shows loading while fetching

**Empty States:**
- When no events exist: friendly message with CTA
- "No events found. Create your first event to get started!"
- Includes "Create New Event" button
- When viewing registrations with no attendees:
  - "No confirmed registrations for this event"

**Error Handling:**
- Error messages displayed in red alert box at top
- Errors logged to console for debugging
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- All async operations wrapped in error handlers

**User Experience:**
- Hover effects on event cards (shadow appears)
- Smooth transitions on all interactive elements
- Modal overlays prevent background interaction
- Click outside modal to close
- Disabled buttons have reduced opacity
- Tooltips on disabled Edit button
- Visual feedback during delete operation

**Page Layout:**
- Header with "Event Management" title
- "Create New Event" button in top-right
- Event cards in single column grid
- Maximum width 1200px, centered
- Clean spacing and borders

**Component Integration:**
- Uses EventService for event operations (task-17)
- Uses ReservationService for registration data (task-20)
- Uses event.model utilities for formatting (task-16)
- Protected by adminGuard (admin-only access)
- Links to event creation form (task-18)

**Data Flow:**
1. Component loads → subscribes to getEventsStream()
2. Events received → sorted by date → rendered as cards
3. User clicks "View Registrations" → fetches reservations
4. User clicks "Delete" → shows confirmation
5. Confirmation → deletes event → stream updates list
6. All changes propagate via real-time Firestore streams

**Styling:**
- Professional card-based design
- Consistent color scheme (blue primary, gray secondary)
- Responsive grid layout
- Mobile-friendly with stacked elements on small screens
- Cards have white background with subtle border
- Hover effects add depth with shadow
- Modals centered with dark overlay
- Status badges use semantic colors

**Responsive Design:**
- Desktop: Multiple columns for event details
- Mobile: Single column, stacked buttons
- Header stacks vertically on mobile
- Modals adapt to screen size (95% width on mobile)
- Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile
- All text remains readable on small screens

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Total bundle size: 631.97 kB initial (171.78 kB transfer)
- Events component: 17.78 kB (4.39 kB transfer)
- CSS file: 4.55 kB (slightly over 4 kB budget)
- Build time: 1.534 seconds
- Lazy loading ensures component only loads when accessed

**Security:**
- Route protected by adminGuard
- Only authenticated admin users can access
- Delete operation enforced by Firestore security rules
- No client-side privilege checks (server validates)

**Performance:**
- Real-time streams update efficiently
- Events automatically sorted in memory
- Lazy loaded component (not in initial bundle)
- Minimal re-renders with Angular OnPush strategy
- Date formatting cached in component methods

**Limitations:**
- Edit functionality not implemented (disabled button)
- No pagination (all events loaded at once)
- No search/filter UI (events only sorted by date)
- Delete doesn't cascade to reservations (manual cleanup needed)
- Past events can't be deleted (button disabled)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Implement edit event form and route
- Add search and filter controls
- Add pagination for large event lists
- Add bulk operations (delete multiple)
- Add export to CSV functionality
- Add event duplication feature
- Show event statistics (attendance rate, etc.)

**Next Steps:**
- Task-21: Build user event browsing interface
- Task-22: Implement user event registration functionality
- Task-23: Create user dashboard with registered events
- Admins can now manage all events from one interface

The admin event management view is complete and ready for use!
