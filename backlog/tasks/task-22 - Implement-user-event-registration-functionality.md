## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented complete user event registration functionality with modal confirmations and real-time updates.

**Core Features Implemented:**
- Registration confirmation modal with event details
- Cancellation confirmation modal with 24-hour policy warning
- Real-time user reservation tracking via getUserReservationsStream()
- Visual indicators for registered events (blue "Registered" badge)
- Success/error message feedback system
- Smart button states (Register/Cancel based on registration status)

**Integration with ReservationService:**
- registerForEvent() for creating reservations
- cancelRegistration() for canceling bookings
- getUserReservationsStream() for real-time reservation updates
- Automatic double-booking prevention (service validates)
- Automatic capacity checking (service validates)

**UI Components Added:**
- Registration modal: Shows event title, date, time, location with confirm/cancel actions
- Cancellation modal: Shows event title with 24-hour policy warning
- Success alert: Green banner for successful operations
- Error alert: Red banner for failures with descriptive messages
- Registered badge: Blue badge on event cards for user's reservations
- Dynamic button logic: "Register Now"/"Event Full"/"Cancel Registration" based on state

**State Management:**
- userReservations: Array of user's active reservations
- userReservedEventIds: Set for fast event lookup
- Modal states: eventToRegister, eventToCancel, reservationToCancel
- Loading states: isRegistering, isCancelling
- Message states: successMessage, errorMessage

**User Experience:**
- Click "Register Now" → Confirmation modal → Success message → Button changes to "Cancel Registration"
- Click "Cancel Registration" → Cancellation modal → Success message → Button changes back to "Register Now"
- Full events show disabled "Event Full" button
- Registered events show blue "Registered" badge immediately via real-time stream
- Clicking overlay closes modals (stopPropagation on modal content)
- Clear, actionable error messages (e.g., "Cannot cancel within 24 hours")

**Files Modified:**
- src/app/user/events/events.ts: Added registration/cancellation logic, user reservation tracking (347 lines)
- src/app/user/events/events.html: Added modals and updated button logic (207 lines)
- src/app/user/events/events.css: Added modal styles, success alert, badges, cancel button (408 lines)

**Build:** 52.44 kB (up from 32.93 kB), all acceptance criteria met
