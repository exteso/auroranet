<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research and choose a calendar library for Angular.
2. Install and configure the chosen calendar library.
3. Generate a new Angular component for the calendar view (event-calendar).
4. Integrate the calendar component into the event-calendar component's template.
5. Implement the service method to fetch all events.
6. Implement the logic to transform the events into a format that the calendar library can understand.
7. Customize the calendar view to visually distinguish between morning and afternoon events.
8. Implement the functionality to handle date clicks and display the events for the selected date.
9. Implement the calendar navigation (previous/next month).
10. Highlight the current date.
11. Add the new component to the routing.
12. Ensure admin event creation is limited to a 2-month window.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Researched and chose `angular-calendar` as the calendar library.
Installed and configured the library, including adding the necessary CSS to `angular.json`.
Created the `event-calendar` component to display the calendar.
Integrated the calendar component and implemented the logic to fetch and display events from the `EventService`.
Customized the calendar to visually distinguish between morning and afternoon events using different colors.
Implemented calendar navigation and date clicking to view events.
Added the new component to the routing at `/user/calendar`.
Verified that the admin event creation form correctly limits date selection to the next 2 months.
