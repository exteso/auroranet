## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up the foundational routing structure for the application with separate routes for authentication, admin dashboard, and user dashboard. Configure lazy loading for feature modules.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 App routing module is configured with base routes
- [x] #2 Auth routes are defined (login, register)
- [x] #3 Admin routes are defined with route guards
- [x] #4 User routes are defined for event browsing and registration
- [x] #5 Lazy loading is configured for feature modules
- [x] #6 404 Not Found route is implemented
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review current app.routes.ts structure
2. Define route structure for auth (login, register)
3. Define route structure for admin (dashboard, events)
4. Define route structure for users (events, dashboard)
5. Create placeholder components for each route
6. Configure lazy loading strategy
7. Add 404 not found route
8. Test navigation between routes
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully configured base application routing structure with lazy loading.

**Components Created:**
- Auth: Login, Register
- Admin: Dashboard, Events
- User: Dashboard, Events  
- NotFound (404)

**Routes Configured:**
- Default route redirects to /auth/login
- Auth routes: /auth/login, /auth/register
- Admin routes: /admin/dashboard, /admin/events (guards will be added in task-15)
- User routes: /user/events, /user/dashboard
- Wildcard route for 404 Not Found

**Lazy Loading:**
- All routes use loadComponent() with dynamic imports
- Build verification shows separate chunk files for each route
- Lazy chunks: login (297 bytes), register (306 bytes), dashboards (309 bytes each), events (300 bytes each), not-found (308 bytes)

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Initial bundle: 465.97 kB
- 7 lazy-loaded chunk files created

The routing structure is ready. Route guards will be implemented in task-15.
