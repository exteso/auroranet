## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create an Angular service to handle Firebase authentication operations including login, logout, registration, and authentication state management.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 AuthService is created with Firebase Auth integration
- [x] #2 Login method with email/password is implemented
- [x] #3 Registration method with email/password is implemented
- [x] #4 Logout method is implemented
- [x] #5 Authentication state observable is exposed
- [x] #6 Error handling for auth operations is implemented
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Generate AuthService using Angular CLI
2. Inject Firebase Auth into the service
3. Implement login method with signInWithEmailAndPassword
4. Implement register method with createUserWithEmailAndPassword
5. Implement logout method with signOut
6. Create authentication state observable using authState
7. Add error handling for all methods
8. Test service methods and verify build

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented complete Firebase Authentication service.

**Service Created:**
- AuthService located at src/app/services/auth.ts
- Uses dependency injection with Angular's inject() function
- Singleton service with providedIn: 'root'

**Methods Implemented:**
- `login(email, password)`: Sign in with email/password using signInWithEmailAndPassword
- `register(email, password)`: Create new user with createUserWithEmailAndPassword
- `logout()`: Sign out current user with signOut
- `getCurrentUser()`: Get current Firebase user
- `isAuthenticated()`: Check if user is logged in

**Authentication State:**
- `authState$`: Observable that emits current authentication state
- Uses Firebase authState() for real-time auth updates
- Components can subscribe to track login/logout changes

**Error Handling:**
- All methods return Observables using RxJS from()
- Firebase errors propagate through Observable streams
- Components can handle errors with catchError operator

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Bundle size unchanged (465.97 kB)
- Service ready for use in components

The AuthService is now ready for integration with login/registration components (task-14) and route guards (task-15).
