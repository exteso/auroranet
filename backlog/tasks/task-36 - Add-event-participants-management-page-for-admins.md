## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create an admin interface to view and manage participants for individual events. Admins need the ability to see who has registered for an event and manually add users who want to attend but haven't registered through the normal flow. This is useful for walk-in registrations, special invitations, or administrative corrections.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Admin can navigate from the Event Management page to event detail page showing participant list
- [x] #2 Page displays all registered participants with user details (name, email, phone, registration date)
- [x] #3 Admin can search and filter the participant list
- [x] #4 Admin can see participant count and capacity information
- [x] #5 Admin can manually add existing users to the event from a user selection modal
- [x] #6 Admin can remove participants from the event with confirmation dialog
- [x] #7 Page shows real-time participant updates
- [x] #8 Export participant list functionality (CSV or print-friendly view)
- [x] #9 Appropriate success/error messages for all operations
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze existing codebase structure and understand routing/component patterns
2. Create new route for event participants page (/admin/events/:eventId/participants)
3. Generate new Angular component for event-participants management
4. Implement participant list view with real-time updates using ReservationService.getEventReservationsStream()
5. Add search and filter functionality for participants (by name, email, etc.)
6. Create "Add User" modal to select and add existing users to the event
7. Implement remove participant functionality with confirmation dialog
8. Add participant count and capacity display
9. Implement export functionality (CSV download or print-friendly view)
10. Add navigation link from Events page to Participants page
11. Implement success/error message handling for all operations
12. Test all functionality and verify acceptance criteria
