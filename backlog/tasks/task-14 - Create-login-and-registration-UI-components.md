## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Build the user interface components for login and registration pages with form validation, error handling, and user feedback.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Login component is created with email/password form
- [x] #2 Registration component is created with email/password form
- [x] #3 Form validation is implemented (required fields, email format, password strength)
- [x] #4 Error messages are displayed for invalid credentials or registration failures
- [x] #5 Loading states are shown during auth operations
- [x] #6 Successful login redirects to appropriate dashboard (admin/user)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Update login component with reactive form and validation
2. Update registration component with reactive form and validation
3. Inject AuthService and Router into both components
4. Implement form submission handlers
5. Add error handling and display error messages
6. Add loading states during authentication
7. Implement redirect logic after successful login
8. Test forms and verify build

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented complete login and registration UI with forms, validation, and Firebase integration.

**Login Component (src/app/auth/login/):**
- Reactive form with email and password fields
- Email format validation and required field checks
- Password minimum length validation (6 characters)
- Integration with AuthService for authentication
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading state during authentication
- Redirect to /user/dashboard after successful login
- Link to registration page

**Registration Component (src/app/auth/register/):**
- Reactive form with email, password, and confirm password
- All validations from login component
- Password matching validation
- Custom validator for password confirmation
- Error handling for registration failures
- Loading state during account creation
- Redirect to /user/dashboard after successful registration
- Link to login page

**Form Validation:**
- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Password minimum length (6 characters)
- Password matching validation for registration
- Real-time validation feedback
- Disabled submit button when form is invalid

**Error Handling:**
- Firebase error codes mapped to user-friendly messages
- Display errors for invalid credentials
- Display errors for registration issues (email in use, weak password, etc.)
- Error messages styled with red alert boxes

**User Experience:**
- Clean, centered form layout with card design
- Green color scheme for primary actions
- Loading states: "Logging in..." / "Creating account..."
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Input focus states with green borders
- Invalid field indicators with red borders

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Login component: 6.09 kB (lazy loaded)
- Registration component: 7.39 kB (lazy loaded)
- Total bundle: 492.71 kB initial, 139.08 kB estimated transfer

The authentication UI is complete and ready for use. Role-based routing will be added in task-15.
