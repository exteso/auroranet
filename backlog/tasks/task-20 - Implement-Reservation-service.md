## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create an Angular service to handle event registration and slot reservation operations, including checking availability and managing user reservations.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 ReservationService is created with Firestore integration
- [x] #2 registerForEvent method is implemented
- [x] #3 cancelRegistration method is implemented
- [x] #4 getUserReservations method is implemented
- [x] #5 checkEventAvailability method verifies capacity
- [x] #6 Method prevents double-booking same user for same event
- [x] #7 Real-time updates for reservation changes
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Create ReservationService using Angular CLI
2. Import Firestore modules and Reservation models
3. Implement registerForEvent with:
   - Double-booking prevention check
   - Event capacity availability check
   - Create reservation in Firestore
   - Update event registeredCount via EventService
4. Implement cancelRegistration with:
   - 24-hour cancellation policy check
   - Update reservation status to CANCELLED
   - Update event registeredCount via EventService
5. Implement getUserReservations (query by userId)
6. Implement checkEventAvailability (capacity check)
7. Add real-time observable streams for reservations
8. Add comprehensive error handling
9. Verify build and test integration

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented comprehensive ReservationService with full reservation management, capacity checking, and real-time streams.

**ReservationService (src/app/services/reservation.ts):**

**Core Methods:**

1. **registerForEvent(reservationData, userId, userEmail, userDisplayName): Observable<string>**
   - Multi-step registration process with validation
   - Step 1: Check for existing reservation (prevent double-booking)
   - Step 2: Verify event capacity availability
   - Step 3: Get event details for registeredCount
   - Step 4: Create reservation document in Firestore with CONFIRMED status
   - Step 5: Update event registeredCount via EventService.updateRegisteredCount()
   - Auto-generates createdAt and updatedAt timestamps
   - Returns created reservation ID
   - Throws errors for: double-booking, full events, event not found

2. **cancelRegistration(reservationId): Observable<void>**
   - Multi-step cancellation process with policy enforcement
   - Step 1: Fetch reservation and validate exists + is CONFIRMED
   - Step 2: Get event details for date and registeredCount
   - Step 3: Check 24-hour cancellation policy via canCancelReservation()
   - Step 4: Update reservation status to CANCELLED
   - Step 5: Decrease event registeredCount via EventService.updateRegisteredCount()
   - Throws errors for: reservation not found, not active, within 24hrs, event not found

3. **getUserReservations(userId, activeOnly?): Observable<ReservationDocument[]>**
   - Retrieves all reservations for specific user
   - Optional activeOnly filter (only CONFIRMED status)
   - Ordered by createdAt descending (newest first)
   - Returns empty array on error

4. **getEventReservations(eventId, activeOnly?): Observable<ReservationDocument[]>**
   - Retrieves all reservations for specific event
   - Optional activeOnly filter (only CONFIRMED status)
   - Ordered by createdAt ascending (first-come first-served)
   - Useful for admin to see event attendees
   - Returns empty array on error

5. **checkEventAvailability(eventId): Observable<boolean>**
   - Checks if event has space (registeredCount < capacity)
   - Returns false if event not found
   - Called during registration process

6. **checkExistingReservation(userId, eventId): Observable<boolean>** (private)
   - Prevents double-booking by checking for existing CONFIRMED reservation
   - Queries by userId + eventId + status=CONFIRMED
   - Returns true if user already has reservation
   - Called during registration process

**Real-time Observable Streams:**

7. **getUserReservationsStream(userId, activeOnly?): Observable<ReservationDocument[]>**
   - Real-time stream of user reservations
   - Updates automatically when reservations change in Firestore
   - Optional activeOnly filter
   - Ordered by createdAt descending
   - Ideal for user dashboard showing live reservation updates

8. **getEventReservationsStream(eventId, activeOnly?): Observable<ReservationDocument[]>**
   - Real-time stream of event reservations
   - Updates automatically when reservations change
   - Optional activeOnly filter
   - Ordered by createdAt ascending
   - Ideal for admin to monitor event registrations in real-time

**Integration with EventService:**
- registerForEvent() calls EventService.updateRegisteredCount() to increment count
- cancelRegistration() calls EventService.updateRegisteredCount() to decrement count
- EventService automatically updates event status to FULL when capacity reached
- EventService automatically updates event status to SCHEDULED when capacity not reached
- This keeps event capacity and status synchronized with actual reservations

**Business Rules Enforced:**
- **Double-booking prevention**: User cannot have multiple CONFIRMED reservations for same event
- **Capacity checking**: Cannot register if event is full (registeredCount >= capacity)
- **24-hour cancellation policy**: User cannot cancel within 24 hours of event start
- **Status validation**: Can only cancel CONFIRMED reservations
- **Count synchronization**: Event registeredCount always matches actual CONFIRMED reservations

**Error Handling:**
- All methods include catchError operators
- Console logging for debugging
- Descriptive error messages for business rule violations
- Graceful degradation (return empty arrays for queries)
- Errors thrown for critical operations (register, cancel)

**Query Capabilities:**
- Filter by userId (getUserReservations)
- Filter by eventId (getEventReservations)
- Filter by status (activeOnly parameter)
- Ordering: newest first for user view, oldest first for admin view
- Real-time streams with same filtering options

**Firestore Integration:**
- Collection reference: 'reservations'
- Uses @angular/fire/firestore v20
- Query constraints built dynamically
- Automatic ID mapping with idField option
- Integrates with EventService for count updates

**Observable Patterns:**
- All methods return Observables for async operations
- Uses RxJS operators: switchMap (chained async), map, catchError
- Real-time streams use collectionData()
- throwError() for business rule violations
- from() wraps Firestore promises

**Type Safety:**
- Full TypeScript integration
- ReservationDocument interface for type checking
- ReservationCreateData for creation operations
- ReservationStatus enum for status values
- canCancelReservation() utility from reservation.model.ts

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Total bundle size: 609.95 kB initial (166.62 kB estimated transfer)
- Bundle size warning (exceeds 500 kB budget by 109.95 kB) - acceptable for early development
- Build time: 1.465 seconds

**Integration Points:**
- Ready for user event registration UI (task-22)
- Ready for user dashboard with reservations (task-23)
- Ready for admin event management (task-19) to view attendees
- Integrates with EventService (task-17) for capacity management
- Uses ReservationDocument model from task-16
- Uses EventDocument model from task-16

**Next Steps:**
- Task-18: Build admin event creation form
- Task-19: Create admin event list and management view (show attendees)
- Task-21: Build user event browsing interface
- Task-22: Implement user event registration functionality using registerForEvent()
- Task-23: Create user dashboard with registered events using getUserReservationsStream()

The ReservationService is complete and ready for UI component integration.
