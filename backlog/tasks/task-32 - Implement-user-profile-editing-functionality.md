## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a user profile page where users can view and edit their profile information (display name, avatar, phone, preferences) and persist changes to Firestore. Note: Basic user document creation (uid, email, role) already implemented in task-13. This task extends the User model with additional profile fields and provides UI for editing.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Profile component displays current user information
- [x] #2 Users can edit their display name and profile details
- [x] #3 Profile changes are saved to Firestore users collection
- [x] #4 Profile page shows loading and success/error states
- [x] #5 Users can only access and edit their own profile

- [x] #6 User model is extended with profile fields (displayName, avatarUrl, phone, preferences)

- [x] #7 User profile fields are initialized with default values during registration

- [x] #8 UserService includes updateUserProfile method to persist changes to Firestore
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Extend UserDocument interface with profile fields (displayName, avatarUrl, phone, preferences)
2. Update UserService.createUser() to initialize profile fields with defaults
3. Add UserService.updateUserProfile() method to update Firestore user documents
4. Update Firestore security rules to allow profile field updates
5. Generate profile component using Angular CLI
6. Create profile form with reactive forms and validation
7. Implement profile loading, editing, and saving logic
8. Add route for /user/profile protected by authGuard
9. Test profile creation during registration and profile editing
10. Verify build and mark acceptance criteria

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented complete user profile management system with extended user model, profile editing UI, and Firestore persistence.

**User Model Extensions (src/app/models/user.model.ts):**
- Added UserPreferences interface with emailNotifications, language, timezone fields
- Extended UserDocument interface with optional profile fields:
  - displayName: User's display name
  - avatarUrl: URL to user's avatar image
  - phone: User's phone number
  - preferences: UserPreferences object with notification and localization settings
- All profile fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility

**UserService Updates (src/app/services/user.service.ts):**
- Updated createUser() method:
  - Initializes displayName from email (uses part before @)
  - Sets default empty strings for avatarUrl and phone
  - Creates default preferences (emailNotifications: true, language: 'en', timezone: 'UTC')
  - All new users get complete profile structure on registration
- Added updateUserProfile() method:
  - Accepts Partial<UserDocument> for flexible updates
  - Automatically updates updatedAt timestamp
  - Uses Firestore updateDoc for efficient partial updates
  - Includes error handling with console logging

**Profile Component (src/app/user/profile/):**
- Reactive form with validators:
  - displayName: Required, min 2 characters
  - phone: Optional, E.164 phone number pattern validation
  - avatarUrl: Optional, URL pattern validation (http:// or https://)
  - emailNotifications: Boolean checkbox
  - language: Dropdown with 5 languages (EN, ES, FR, DE, IT)
  - timezone: Dropdown with 8 common timezones
- Profile loading on initialization:
  - Fetches current user document from Firestore
  - Populates form with existing values
  - Shows loading state during fetch
- Profile saving:
  - Validates form before submission
  - Updates Firestore with UserService.updateUserProfile()
  - Shows success message for 3 seconds after save
  - Displays error messages on failure
- User information display:
  - Shows read-only email and role
  - Clear visual distinction from editable fields

**Styling (src/app/user/profile/profile.css):**
- Clean, centered card layout (max-width 600px)
- Form sections with visual separators
- Input focus states with green borders
- Invalid field indicators with red borders
- Success/error message styling
- Profile info panel with left border accent
- Disabled button states
- Responsive form layout

**Routing (src/app/app.routes.ts:58):**
- Added /user/profile route
- Protected by authGuard (authentication required)
- Lazy-loaded for optimal performance
- Users can only access their own profile (enforced by component logic)

**Firestore Security Rules:**
- Existing rules already allow profile updates
- Users can update their own documents (line 38-39 in firestore.rules)
- Role field protection: users cannot change their own role
- Profile field updates allowed: displayName, avatarUrl, phone, preferences
- Security enforced at database level

**Profile Field Initialization:**
- Happens automatically during user registration
- AuthService.register() calls UserService.createUser()
- New users immediately have complete profile structure
- No migration needed for existing users (optional fields)

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Total bundle size: 609.78 kB initial (167.57 kB estimated transfer)
- Profile component lazy-loaded: 9.60 kB (2.65 kB estimated transfer)
- All other lazy-loaded chunks working correctly
- Build time: 1.257 seconds

**User Experience:**
- Profile loads automatically on page visit
- Real-time form validation with error messages
- Clear success feedback after save
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- Form disabled during save operation
- Professional, clean interface matching application style

**Security:**
- Users can only view/edit their own profile (enforced by AuthService)
- Role field cannot be changed by users (Firestore rules)
- Phone and URL validation prevent invalid data
- All updates go through secured Firestore rules
- Authentication required to access profile page

**Features:**
- Display name editing with validation
- Phone number with E.164 format validation
- Avatar URL with URL format validation
- Email notification preferences toggle
- Language selection (5 languages)
- Timezone selection (8 common timezones)
- Profile info display (email, role - read-only)

The user profile management system is complete and fully functional. Users can now edit their profiles immediately after registration, and all changes are persisted to Firestore with proper validation and security.
