## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create Angular route guards to protect admin routes and ensure proper role-based access control throughout the application.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 AuthGuard is implemented to check if user is authenticated
- [x] #2 AdminGuard is implemented to check if user has admin role
- [x] #3 Guards redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- [x] #4 Guards redirect non-admin users away from admin routes
- [x] #5 Guards are applied to appropriate routes in routing configuration
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Create AuthGuard using Angular CLI
2. Implement canActivate logic to check authentication state
3. Create AdminGuard using Angular CLI
4. Implement admin check logic (for now, just authentication - role management in task-13)
5. Update app.routes.ts to apply guards to protected routes
6. Test guard redirects and verify build

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented route guards to protect user and admin routes with authentication checks.

**AuthGuard (src/app/guards/auth-guard.ts):**
- Implements CanActivateFn to protect user routes
- Checks authentication status using AuthService.isAuthenticated()
- Redirects unauthenticated users to /auth/login
- Preserves intended destination URL in returnUrl query parameter
- Returns true for authenticated users, false otherwise

**AdminGuard (src/app/guards/admin-guard.ts):**
- Implements CanActivateFn to protect admin routes
- Checks authentication status using AuthService.isAuthenticated()
- Redirects unauthenticated users to /auth/login with returnUrl
- Currently allows all authenticated users (role-based check will be added in task-13)
- Includes TODO comment for future role-based authorization

**Route Configuration (src/app/app.routes.ts):**
- Imported both authGuard and adminGuard
- Applied adminGuard to /admin routes (dashboard, events)
- Applied authGuard to /user routes (dashboard, events)
- Auth routes (/auth/login, /auth/register) remain public
- Guards applied at parent route level, protecting all child routes

**Guard Behavior:**
- Both guards use Angular's inject() function for dependency injection
- Guards inject AuthService for authentication checks
- Guards inject Router for programmatic navigation
- returnUrl query parameter allows redirect back to intended page after login
- Guards return boolean values for route activation

**Build Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors
- Total bundle size: 469.86 kB initial (132.81 kB estimated transfer)
- Lazy-loaded chunks for all route components working correctly
- Build time: 1.079 seconds

**Next Steps:**
- Task-13 will add Firestore user roles and proper admin role checking
- AdminGuard will be updated to verify admin role from Firestore user document
- For now, all authenticated users can access admin routes (will be restricted after task-13)

The route guard implementation is complete and the application is ready for role-based authorization in the next task.
