## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Defined mobile breakpoints in `styles.css`.
Created `_responsive.scss` for responsive mixins and imported it into `styles.css`.
Refactored the main layout and navigation in `app.html` and `app.css` to be responsive.
Implemented a hamburger menu for mobile navigation.
Made forms (login and registration) more touch-friendly by increasing font sizes and padding.
Verified that event lists/grids (admin and user events) already stack properly on small screens due to existing CSS.
Added basic responsive styles to `event-calendar.css` to make the calendar usable on mobile.
Manual testing on multiple screen sizes is required to fully verify responsiveness.
